Mchezopesa Ltd (fictional Betting company) requires a football match predcition model of a game between team 1 and team 2 (any 2 teams input) that's based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training). The first approach used is Polynomial regression and two models were built, then the other approach used was Logistic classification.
